# <i class="fa-solid fa-database"></i> Data curation


Data curation is the process of creating, organizing, and maintaining data sets so that people seeking information can access and use them. Curation involves collecting, structuring, indexing, and cataloging data for users within an organization, group, or the general public. In this session, we will ensure that we have the scientific computing skills necessary to **clean**, **explore**, **summarize**, and **visualize** data efficiently using the tools you were introduced to last semester: the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries.
